# Accessing Server for NGS hands-on lab (ProgrammingLaboratory for Bioinformatics 2020-21)

Brief tutorial on how to access and Infomics lab server and transfer files from local computers to the server.

### Prerequisites:

- Valid VPN access (UniVR GIA + passwordrequired) Further details at [https://www.univr.it/en/our-services/-/servizi/ssl-vpn-secure-remote-access](https://www.univr.it/en/our-services/-/servizi/ssl-vpn-secure-remote-access).
